# 🧠 AI Responses to the Japanese National Medical Licensing Examination (JMLE)

This repository presents AI-generated responses to questions from the **Japanese National Medical Licensing Examination (JMLE)**, using multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluated in parallel.

---

## 📄 Project Overview

- **Source**: Past JMLE questions (translated and formatted for AI input)
- **Models**: GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5/3.7, Gemini 1.5, and other major LLMs
- **Method**: All models are queried simultaneously via [Tenbin AI](https://tenbin.ai), a platform that enables side-by-side evaluation
- **Question type**: Current focus is on **text-only questions** that do not require image interpretation
- **Output Format**: One Markdown file per question (e.g., `119-A10.md`)
- **SMAQ (custom ChatGPT-based assistant)**: Responses are provided separately in grouped batches (e.g., `119-A10-19SMAQ.md`)

## 🎯 Purpose

This project **does not aim to provide correct answers.**  
Instead, it offers:

- Insight into how LLMs **reason through clinical questions**
- A resource for medical learners and professionals to **compare, reflect, and verify**
- A platform to **stimulate critical thinking**, not passive memorization

> ✅ **Note**: At this stage, only **text-based questions** are included.  
> Image-based or visually dependent questions are excluded from initial publication.
